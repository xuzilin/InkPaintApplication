InkPaintApplication
===================

I tried to simulate ink(water) in this program, so it is a little different from painter application in windows.
Windows painter is like pencils or charks painter. Any points created in it are clearly and outstanding. But in this
application, they flows.
Here is a picture illustrates the difference.
